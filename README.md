# F1 Data Analysis
In this project, I want to create a model that predicts qualifying result and hopefully will be able to predict the top 3-5 in the future and create a model that based on the Qualifying prediction makes a model that predicts the race winner or where the polesitter will finish.
## Learning
### Feature Importance and Logistic Regression
[DataCamp-Model Validation](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/model-validation-in-python/cross-validation?ex=4) <br>
[DataCamp-K Fold Cross Validation](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/k-fold-cross-validation) <br>
[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/understanding-feature-importance-in-logistic-regression-models/)

I completed 80 courses on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/JamieWoodward?view=true) on Python, SQL and Machine Learning Theory in order to prepare for this project

### Telemetry
[FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev) gives Free Practice and Qualifying data as well as speed through at the lap

### Weather Data
[Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/en/) gives weather data such as rain and wind speed during the races
